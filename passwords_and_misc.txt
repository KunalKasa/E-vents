mysql_pwd = E/vents123

for it to work successfully we need to grant all priviledges to 'root'@'localhost' and 
if we set a password for it then we need to change it in C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php
here update 
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] =";

and replace it with

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'Type your root password here';
